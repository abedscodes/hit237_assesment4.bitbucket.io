Thesis Project Management Web Application

Project Overview

This project introduces an interactive web application designed to improve thesis project management for Charles Darwin University (CDU) Master of Information Technology students, thesis supervisors, and Unit Coordinators. Using Django, this application will streamline workflows, reduce errors, and enhance communication for thesis topic management, student-supervisor agreements, and project tracking.

Current System Overview

Currently, thesis project management relies on manual processes through emails, Excel, and Word documents, leading to inefficiencies, errors, and communication bottlenecks. This application will address the limitations of the existing system by introducing centralized, automated workflows.

Pain Points Addressed

Inefficient Workflow: Repetitive tasks and email overload.
Supervisor Capacity Blind Spots: Lack of visibility into supervisor availability.
Form Errors and Delays: Frequent inaccuracies and rework.
Manual Data Management: Double data entry and redundant updates.

Business Rules

The application complies with the following:

All changes to thesis topics must be approved by the Unit Coordinator.

Students can only begin work once their application is submitted and approved.

Thesis project groups must include 3 to 5 students.


Key Functionalities

Thesis Topic Management

Supervisors can add, update, and request topic removal.

The Unit Coordinator can approve and publish topics for student access.
Project Applications

Students can apply for thesis topics as groups, with visibility into supervisor availability.

Supervisors can directly approve or reject applications.

Automated Record-Keeping

All approved project applications are recorded, organized, and accessible by the Unit Coordinator.


Anticipated Benefits

Efficiency: Automation reduces manual tasks and errors.

Enhanced Communication: The platform promotes transparent communication among all stakeholders.

Accessibility: Accessible from any device, any time.

Data Integrity: Secure data storage and controlled access to sensitive information.
